
Kindly notice that the code inside the folder named Backup_SourceCode_Reference and  ml or mllib are not belong to me.
They were the important learning nutrient for me ,
and them built me a solid fundation  of the K means algorithm. 
It help me familiar with K means ' pros and cons under different Data Structure, platform, model and so on.


Much appreciated for their sharing. 
Without them, I can not bulit my own K means Algorithm with only RDD structure and MapReduce Based Algorithm.
